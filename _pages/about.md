Welcome to Ejiro Umaka's webpage!

I am currently a research associate at Brookhaven National Laboratory working on the sPHENIX experiment. My research focuses on understanding properties of the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions.

I also work on the commissioning and data quality of sPHENIX calorimeter subsystems.
